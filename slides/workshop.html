<h2>Workshop</h2>

<p>
    Try to build a basic REST API with resource endpoints that support GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Use an entity of your choice from the examples in these slides (Cars, books, products etc.).
    <br>
    The API should return correct media information and if necessary serialize the resource/object in a suitable format.
    <br>
    Try to validate that your endpoint is handling the HTTP verbs correctly. It is optional to implement persist procedures for storing to a database.
