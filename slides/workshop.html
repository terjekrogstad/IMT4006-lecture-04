<h2>Workshop</h2>

<p>
    Try to build a basic REST api with resource endpoints that support GET, POST, PUT and DELETE. Use an entity of your choice from the examples in these slides (Cars, books, products etc.). Try to validate that your endpoint is handling the HTTP verbs correctly. It is optional to implement persist procedures for storing to a database.
